# File Name Generator Tool

This tool automates the process of generating filenames based on specific conditions. Instead of manually typing and formatting file names, you can input a string and select the desired file extension, and the tool will format the filename accordingly.

## Features

- Input any string and automatically format it by removing periods and replacing spaces with underscores.
- Choose from Java, SQL, and Python file extensions.
- Copy the generated filename to your clipboard with one click.

## How It Works

1. Enter a string such as:  
   `1581. Customer Who Visited but Did Not Make Any Transactions`
   
2. Select the desired file extension (e.g., `.java`, `.sql`, `.python`).

3. The tool will automatically transform the string into a valid filename, like:  
   `Q1581_Customer_Who_Visited_but_Did_Not_Make_Any_Transactions.java`

4. Click "Copy to Clipboard" to copy the filename and use it.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to save time by automating the repetitive process of manually formatting filenames. This tool is especially useful for developers working on multiple files where consistency in file naming is important.
