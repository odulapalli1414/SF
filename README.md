# 🚀 File Name Generator Tool

This project is designed to automate the generation of file names based on your input conditions, so you no longer have to manually create file names every time. Simply provide a string and select the desired file extension, and let the tool do the rest!

## ✨ Features

- **Dynamic Input**: Enter any string, and the tool will format it by removing periods and replacing spaces with underscores.
- **File Extensions**: Choose from multiple file extensions like `.java`, `.sql`, and `.python` with more to come!
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Instantly copy the generated file name with a single click and start using it right away.
- **Smooth UI**: Enjoy a user-friendly interface that ensures seamless interaction and enhances your productivity.

## 🛠 How It Works

1. **Input**: Enter a string such as:
   ```
   1581. Customer Who Visited but Did Not Make Any Transactions
   ```
2. **Select Extension**: Choose the desired file extension (e.g., `java`, `sql`, or `python`).
3. **Generate**: Click the "Format String" button to see the transformed result:
   ```
   Q1581_Customer_Who_Visited_but_Did_Not_Make_Any_Transactions.java
   ```
4. **Copy**: Click the "Copy to Clipboard" button to copy the generated file name with the extension. No need for manual file creation!

## 🎯 Purpose

The **File Generator Tool** was built to simplify the repetitive process of creating filenames based on specific conditions. Rather than manually replacing characters and adding extensions, this tool streamlines your workflow and improves accuracy by automating the entire process.

Whether you're working on SQL queries, Java programs, or Python scripts, this tool will save you time and effort, ensuring file naming is consistent across your projects.
